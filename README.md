### Background  
SpaceX has revolutionized the aerospace industry by significantly lowering the costs of space travel, making it more accessible. The companyâ€™s achievements include manned spaceflights, launching satellites for global internet access, and missions to the International Space Station. A key reason for its cost efficiency is the reusable first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets, bringing launch costs down to $62 million compared to $165 million for competitors. Predicting whether this first stage can be reused plays a crucial role in estimating the price of launches. Using public data and machine learning, we aim to predict first-stage reusability.

### Key Questions:
1. How do payload mass, launch sites, number of flights, and orbits influence first-stage landing success?  
2. How have success rates changed over time?  
3. Which predictive model best classifies successful landings?

## Executive Summary  

This project identifies factors contributing to successful rocket landings. The approach involves:  
- **Data Collection:** Using SpaceX REST API and web scraping to gather data  
- **Data Wrangling:** Creating a binary success variable  
- **Exploration:** Visualizing factors like payload mass, launch site, flight frequency, and annual trends  
- **Analysis:** Using SQL to compute statistics such as payload ranges for successful launches  
- **Visualization:** Highlighting geographical factors influencing launch site success  
- **Modeling:** Building predictive models, including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and KNN

## Results

### Data Insights:
- Success rates have improved over time.  
- The KSC LC-39A site boasts the highest success rate.  
- Certain orbits (ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO) consistently achieve 100% success.

### Geographical Observations:
- Launch sites are near the equator, offering cost-saving benefits due to Earth's rotational speed.  
- All sites are coastal, facilitating easier rocket retrieval.

### Predictive Models:
- All models performed similarly, with the decision tree model slightly outperforming others.

## Methodology

### Data Collection via API:
- Data requested from SpaceX API and processed into dataframes.  
- Missing values for Payload Mass were replaced with the mean.  

### Data Collection via Web Scraping:
- Falcon 9 launch data extracted from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup.  
- Data organized into a structured dataframe and exported to CSV.

### Data Wrangling:
- Landing outcomes converted into binary format: 1 (successful) or 0 (unsuccessful).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Charts and visualizations created to analyze relationships between factors.  
- SQL queries performed to derive insights into payload ranges and outcomes.  

### Mapping and Dashboards:
- Maps created using Folium to visualize launch sites and their proximities.  
- Dashboards designed with Plotly Dash to display success metrics.

### Predictive Analytics:
- Data standardized and split into training and test sets.  
- Models built using GridSearchCV for parameter optimization.  
- Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and KNN.  
- Performance evaluated using metrics like Jaccard Score, F1 Score, and Accuracy.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings:
- **Launch Success Trends:** Success rates have improved over time.  
- **Geographical Advantage:** Launch sites near the equator and coast aid in cost reduction and reusability.  
- **Optimal Launch Site:** KSC LC-39A achieves the highest success rates, especially for payloads under 5,500 kg.  
- **Orbit Success Rates:** Orbits ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO consistently succeed.  
- **Payload Mass Impact:** Higher payload masses correlate with increased success rates.

### Recommendations:
1. **Expand Dataset:** A larger dataset will improve model reliability and result generalization.  
2. **Advanced Feature Analysis:** Use techniques like PCA to refine predictive capabilities.  
3. **Consider XGBoost:** Testing advanced models like XGBoost may enhance accuracy.
